# About my ML Model



HI Everyone,

In this model, I did complete data science life cycle. I have a loan application dataset. It has many features which helps banking 
team to decide whether the user is eligible for loan or not. It is the case of classification problem with 2 classes ( Approved 
or Not Appoved).

What I did here:

  1.  Desctriptive Analysis
  2.  Basic Statistics
  3. Missing Value Handling
  4.  Encoding Categorical Features
  5.  Visualization & Story Telling
  6.  Train Test Split
  7.  Random Forest Algorithm
  8.  Model Tuning using GridSearch and k-fold
  9.  Performance Metics.
